   'OMG 2 Controversy: In a surprising turn of events, the highly anticipated sequel to the blockbuster "OMG - Oh My God!" is embroiled in a heated controversy. Reports suggest that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has recommended altering Akshay Kumar\'s iconic portrayal of Lord Shiva in "OMG 2."  The original film, released several years ago, garnered immense praise for its thought-provoking storyline and Akshay Kumar\'s remarkable performance as the modern-day Lord Shiva. However, with "OMG 2" in the works, the CBFC\'s suggestion to replace Lord Shiva\'s character with a different mythological figure has raised eyebrows among fans and cinephiles alike.  The CBFC\'s decision has sparked debates within the film industry and among audiences about artistic freedom and the portrayal of religious figures on the big screen. Some argue that altering Lord Shiva\'s character could dilute the essence of the film\'s message, which focused on questioning religious practices and embracing spirituality beyond conventions. As the controversy gains momentum, the production team of "OMG 2" has remained tight-lipped about the proposed changes, leaving fans eagerly awaiting an official statement.',

Wider adoption of 5G technology in the telecom sector, increasing expansion of cryptocurrency mining, Blockchain technology, and digitization are increasing the demand for higher Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) of the processing units. The expansion of the semiconductor market has a direct connection to the rising global demand for consumer electronics. Taking note of the opportunities, the Government of India started the programme, ‘SemiconIndia’, to attract large investments to set up the semiconductor industry in the country. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) reported the industry generated revenues of $40.7 billion in May 2023 globally, up 1.7% from April 2023. From the previous year until September 2022, the global semiconductor industry was valued at $500-$600 billion and complements the global electronics industry worth approximately $3 trillion. According to the Strategic Investment Research Unit (SIRU), the Indian semiconductor market has been estimated to be worth $23.2 billion and will continue to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.10% to reach $80.3 billion by 2028.

Ryan added that they are finally meeting the “pent up demand.” Sony PS5 sales were also negatively impacted by the high prices that resellers were charging and selling in the grey market. In India, the PS5 console was being sold for almost one and a half times its MSRP after launch. The disc variant, which launched at Rs 49,990, was often seen being sold for upwards of Rs 65,000 openly online and in offline stores across India. We investigated the alleged black market activity that was affecting sales back in January of this year, and we found that many retailers were alleging that others were selling the console at a premium.",

   'Chip giant TSMC said it is determined to “keep its roots in Taiwan", as it launched a massive new research and development facility in the northern city of Hsinchu on Friday. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) controls more than half the world’s output of microchips, which are the lifeblood of the modern global economy, powering everything from coffee machines and smartphones to cars and missiles. Much of its manufacturing base is in Hsinchu, where its state-of-the-art facilities are producing ever-smaller silicon wafers that have skyrocketed in demand, especially due to the recent boom in AI-related technology. At the Friday launch of its R&D facility, chairman Mark Liu said the centre will “develop world-leading technologies in the semiconductor industry more actively to explore 2-nanometre and 1.4-nanometre technology". The company is racing to begin mass production of the 1.4-nanometre chip — smaller than a fraction of a fingernail — ahead of its rival Samsung, the world’s second-largest producer. Its production lines have expanded beyond Taiwan as Western powers have raised concerns about the crucial industry being centred on an island that China claims as its territory — having ramped up political pressures against it in the past year.',

While this may seem strange, the new wireless controllers for Xbox Series X/S and PC are indeed “pizza-scented.” The controllers are Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themed, and are being released to celebrate the release of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie. Gamers have previously seen numerous limited edition controllers from both Xbox and PlayStation, but this is the first time a controller has included an olfactory element, rather than simply offering a different choice of build materials and color schemes. Xbox has stated that the controller is available in four variations—each representing the signature colors, weapons, and personalities of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo. And to disperse the pizza scent, the controllers have built-in scent diffusers shaped like a slice of New York style pizza. However, the controllers will only be available in limited quantities and only be available through Xbox’s giveaway—meaning you can’t buy them. To participate in the giveaway, fans can enter by following the Xbox Game Pass account on Twitter and retweeting the official Xbox Game Pass sweepstakes tweet. Xbox says that the giveaway for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themed controlled will run from July 24 to August 13, 2023.",

Mappls App is among the top 15 applications in the Google Play Store across all categories, ahead of any other app in related categories (maps and navigation, as well as travel and local). Google Maps is not one of the Google Play Store’s top 100 applications. The app is supported by the most advanced and cutting-edge underlying map data and technology, allowing all users to have the smartest, safest, and most accurate maps and navigation experience possible in the country. The company built India’s very first internet mapping platform and portal, MapmyIndia.com (now called Mappls.com) in 2004. Speaking to News18 about the success, Rohan Verma CEO & ED, MapmyIndia & Mappls, said: “The large majority, 95% of people, from India mainly downloaded Mappls App as the app is mainly focused on giving mapping information about this country. It also happened at a time when we simply did no advertisement. Some NRIs from the US, Canada and the Middle East are also downloading this app, but mainly because they want to see their country.”",

   'Twitter owner Elon Musk recently announced the rebranding of Twitter’s bird logo to an “X," with the aim to create X as a global marketplace centered around audio, video, messaging, payments/banking, and more. The domain X dot com now redirects users to Twitter dot com. Musk mentioned that the new X logo will go live later today. But how many of you know that Twitter’s potential new logo takes Elon Musk back to his tech entrepreneur days when he was a 28-year-old, with aspirations to launch an online banking company in 1999. According to a popular author Walter Isaacson, the infatuation of Elon Musk with the name X.com goes way back. His experience at Scotiabank had convinced him that the industry was ripe for disruption. So in March 1999, he founded X.com. “His concept for X.com was grand. It would be a one-stop everything-store for all financial needs: banking, digital purchases, checking, credit cards, investments, and loans. Transactions would be handled instantly, with no waiting for payments to clear. His insight was that money is simply an entry into a database, and he wanted to devise a way that all transactions were securely recorded in real time," Isaacson wrote on Twitter.',

   'When ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI in November last year, it took the world by storm. The AI-powered language model not only answered queries and provided information, but also eased doing task that took days like writing tasks, analysing datasets and writing codes. While the OpenAI chatbot began to be used by millions worldwide, Google launched an alternative Bard, while Microsoft came up with AI-powered search engine Bing AI or the new Bing. Many other alternatives came out offering similar and more advanced capabilities. However, a new AI tool, termed as malicious cousin of ChatGPT, was launched recently and is being promoted for sale on a hacker forum. WormGPT is based on the GPTJ language model, which was developed in 2021. It reportedly has a range of features, including unlimited character support, chat memory retention and code formatting capabilities. Researchers from cybersecurity firm SlashNext said the cybercrime tool is a blackhat “alternative" to ChatGPT and “lets you do all sorts of illegal stuff and easily sell it online in the future."',

   "Many smartphone users, whether they have Android or iOS devices, rely on the Truecaller app for its spam detection services. Now, it appears that the app is doubling down on its commitment to make life simpler by introducing the Truecaller Assistant in India. The service was launched in Australia and the US last September and is finally making its way to India. Truecaller Assistant answers calls on your behalf when you don’t want to answer them, or when you want to avoid talking to a marketer or a spammer. Truecaller stated that while Caller ID helps identify incoming calls, the Assistant takes it a step further by not only answering the calls but also interacting with the callers. As anticipated, the Truecaller Assistant uses the company’s AI-powered algorithms to enable call screening, but the service is only available for Android users currently. TRUECALLER ASSISTANT: HOW IT WORKS If you have the Truecaller Assistant enabled, you can click ‘Assistant’ to screen a call when you receive one. However, if you are unable or unwilling to answer the call, the Assistant will answer it after a few rings.",

   "2023 is certainly shaping up to be the year of AI, with companies racing to launch their own generative AI models. Meta has followed suit with an upgraded version of its LLaMa LLM model, called Llama 2. Meta has released the model as open source—meaning that it is available for free for both commercial and research purposes. Meta and Microsoft have partnered to distribute Llama 2—which is now available in the Azure AI model catalog. This will allow developers using Microsoft Azure to use and benefit from Llama 2. Now, while Llama 2 is a generative AI model, or more specifically, a Large Language Model (LLM), there are a few key differences between Meta’s Llama 2 and its competitors—including OpenAI’s GPT-4 (ChatGPT) and Google PaLM 2 (Bard). Percy Liang, director of Stanford’s Center for Research on Foundation Models, points out that Meta’s research paper acknowledges that Llama 2 is less powerful than GPT-4 and that there is a performance gap between the two models. In terms of benchmarks, Llama 2 model also performs slightly below its rivals—GPT-4 and PaLM 2.",

It has numerous health benefits, from boosting metabolism, mental health benefits, can close pores and awaken the skin for a glowing complexion, while also aiding the immune system. Wim Hoff’s series Freeze The Fear showed the benefits of cold-water immersion, and since we have seen other celebrities, including Spice Girls Mel C fitness guru Joe Wicks, Madonna, Chris Hemsworth, Kendall Jenner, and presenter Emma Willis also follow suit. But you don’t have to venture to your local gym, or the extreme cold continents, to practice this, as there are a number of DIY ice baths to shop online. It’s important to note hot and cold water therapy is not for everyone, and should be taken slowly and steadily, with calm breaths so not to shock the body. It has been recommended to ease the duration of time in a plunge pool, from one minute, and up to 15 minutes for some experts, but be cautious. ",

It tests lung function by measuring how quickly and effectively a person fills and empties their lungs at maximum effort. “We found that many people who have a lot of primary tobacco exposure have the same symptoms as people who have COPD, but can’t be diagnosed with COPD,” said William McKleroy, first author of the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

The research, published in the journal JAMA Oncology, used data from wearable devices to track the daily activity of over 22,000 ‘non-exercisers’. Researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia then followed the group’s clinical health records for close to seven years to monitor for cancer. They found that four to five minutes of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity or ‘VILPA’ was associated with a substantially lower cancer risk compared to those who undertook no VILPA. Short bursts of activity — around one minute each — includes activities like vigorous housework, carrying heavy shopping around the grocery store, bursts of power walking or playing high-energy games with the kids. Adults who don’t exercise are at increased risk of developing certain cancers like breast, endometrial or colon, but until recently the impact of less structured forms of vigorous physical activity was unable to be measured, the researchers said.",

Any guesses as to what bagged the top spot on this list? It is none other than Indonesia’s decadent ayam goreng, which scored 4.6 stars out of 5. According to Taste Atlas, this Indonesian-style fried chicken consists of chicken cuts, preferably bone-in pieces such as thighs and drumsticks, which are marinated in spices, then shortly braised before being fried until golden and crispy. “The marinade is typically based on traditional spices such as lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, and tamarind, but since the dish is enjoyed throughout the country, it comes in numerous regional variations that may include other spices and marinades, or various additions such as grated coconut or rice flour crumbs,” it said.",

While The Great Liquid Soap and The Sidekick Scrub are important players, they’re no warrior Viking who will change the whole game, and who better to talk to than the actual Vikings of this war: chefs? According to chef Vaibhav Bhargava at Cho, Vietnamese Kitchen and Bar, cleaning kitchen utensils properly helps prevent the growth and spread of harmful bacteria, germs, and other pathogens. “This is especially important in food preparation areas where cross-contamination can occur easily. By regularly cleaning and sanitising utensils, you minimise the risk of foodborne illnesses,” he added. Chef Nikhil Rastogi at UNOX told Indianexpress.com that properly cleaning utensils can also preserve their longevity as “grease accumulation over time can lead to a layer of grime on the utensils, compromising their appearance and potentially affecting the taste of the food prepared with them.”",

The crop yields harvest within 60 days of sowing. Hence, it’s also known as Shastika Shali i.e., rice that grows in 60 days. It is unpolished rice, which is reddish brown in colour, and has been used extensively in Ayurveda, not only as food but also as medicine. It is considered as one of the traditional superfoods owing to its high nutritive values.” Dr Rekha Radhamony, an Ayurveda doctor, highlighted the many benefits of Njavara rice. “Here is a drink that I give to my in-house patients every day at @adirekhaayurveda as a post-treatment drink for instantly improving energy levels and nourishment!” she wrote on Instagram.",

   "Kebabs, the sizzling skewers of marinated meat, have captured the hearts and palates of food lovers around the globe. Every year, on World Kebab Day, enthusiasts from diverse cultures come together to celebrate this beloved dish. This year, the day is being observed on July 14. Celebrating the same, Chef Ranveer Brar took to Instagram to share the rich history of kebabs. “As a true blue Lucknowite and a chef, a familiar query or point of conversation that I inevitably attract is about Biryanis and Kebabs. Given, my heart will always beat a little extra for the Lucknowi Biryani, but let’s save that spicy conversation for another day. Let’s talk about Kebabs today,” he started out saying. According to the chef, kebabs are a gift from Turkey and Russia and made their way to India via the Silk Route. “What happened next was what we do best. A marriage of flavours, spices and techniques to make this dish a ubiquitous part of our cuisine,” he added. He further shared that mentions of kebab-style cooking of meat go as far back as the Mahabharata era. “Where the pre-Mughal kebab was more about marination and open grill cooking, basically more rustic in nature, the Mughal culinarians evolved it into a delicacy, enhancing them with spices, dry fruits and cooking techniques.”",

   "Food without gravy is unthinkable especially in the Indian kitchen and for that one needs tomatoes. But with the price surge hitting tomatoes hard in many markets including states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, many are left wondering if there are some easily found alternatives that can help for the time being. As such, we decided to seek expert opinions on what could be some foods that can replace the taste and flavour of tomatoes to help you in the kitchen. Tarun Shetty, corporate chef, SMAAASH enlisted peeled and canned tomatoes as one of the options. “Tomatoes that have been collected when ripe and heated to seal them in a can are called canned tomatoes. The skin is occasionally torn off and other times it is not. These tomatoes can be utilised in a variety of ways, whether they are whole, chopped, or crushed,” said Shetty. Another suggestion was to substitute it with tamarind for its tangy and sweet flavour. Registered dietitian Garima Goyal concurred and shared that the tangy flavour is way more pronounced than tomatoes.",

Notably, Hasina sent 500 kg of mangoes to Saha. P B Jamatia, director, horticulture department was responsible for handing over 100 boxes of the “specially plucked kew variety of pineapples” at the Assistant High Commission of India, Chittagong in Dhaka, reported PTI. “The chief minister, as part of a goodwill gesture, sent 980 kg of pineapples to Prime Minister Hasina. We are honoured to send the gift,” Jamatia told PTI. What is special about this variety? Jamatia added that the variety is known for its unique taste, smell, and size. Kew variety is a late-maturing pineapple variety and is the leading commercial variety in India, said registered dietitian Garima Goyal who added that it is valued particularly for its canning quality or can be preserved in a can for longer. “Fruit weighs 2-3 kgs, and is oblong in shape. It slightly tapers towards the crown. Eyes are broad and shallow making the fruit more suitable for canning. The fruit is yellow when fully ripe. The flesh is light yellow, almost fibreless, and very juicy with 0.6-1.2 per cent acid, and its TSS content (sugar content measures which include carbohydrates, organic acids, proteins, fats and minerals of the fruit) varies from 12-16 brix,” said Goyal.",

   "Up to two servings a day of dairy, mainly whole-fat, can be included in a healthy diet as it may protect against high blood pressure and metabolic disorders, according to a study using data from 80 countries. The research, published on Friday in the European Heart Journal, found that diets emphasising fruit, vegetables, dairy (mainly whole-fat), nuts, legumes and fish were linked with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature death in all world regions. The addition of unprocessed red meat or whole grains had little impact on outcomes, the researchers said. Low-fat foods have taken centre stage with the public, food industry and policymakers, with nutrition labels focused on reducing fat and saturated fat, they said. “Our findings suggest that the priority should be increasing protective foods such as nuts (often avoided as too energy dense), fish and dairy, rather than restricting dairy (especially whole-fat) to very low amounts,” said study author Andrew Mente from McMaster University, Canada. “Our results show that up to two servings a day of dairy, mainly whole-fat, can be included in a healthy diet. This is in keeping with modern nutrition science showing that dairy, particularly whole-fat, may protect against high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome,” Mente said.",

Whether it’s the chapati in India, the pita in the Middle East, or the tortilla in Mexico, they are cherished for their convenience and adaptability. If you are someone who can’t get enough of flatbreads, you must check out the latest rankings of the world’s best flatbreads, released by Taste Atlas, an experiential travel online guide for traditional food. “Flatbreads have been enjoyed across different cultures for centuries, with each region adding its own distinct flavours and techniques to this culinary creation. While determining the absolute best flatbread would be an impossible task for anyone, we’ve turned to mathematics and counted your votes – as we always do,” it wrote. Roti canai from Malaysia, a traditional pan-fried flatbread made with flour, water, eggs, and fat, has been ranked the best flatbread. “The dough for roti canai is repeatedly folded, so the final product has a layered texture, a soft interior, and a crispy outer layer. The most common fat used in roti canai is ghee, the traditional Indian clarified butter. It is believed that the dish originated in India when the Indian labourers who migrated to Malaysia brought the recipe and the tradition of preparing this crispy pastry to the foreign country,” Taste Atlas said.",

   "Septing for seasonal vegetables is an excellent choice for maintaining a consistent nutritional intake while staying budget-friendly. In fact, the best part about including seasonal fruits and vegetables in your diet is their inherent ability to fight seasonal illnesses and flu. As such, it is time to brief you about a little-known monsoon vegetable – Kantoli. Available in monsoon, Kantoli is a spiky vegetable resembling lychee in appearance. Its scientific name is Momordica dioica, commonly known as spiny gourd or spine gourd and also as bristly balsma pear, prickly carolaho, and teasle gourd. Kantoli, a species of flowering plants in the gourd family, is used as a vegetable in all regions of India and some parts of South Asia. It falls under the category of medicinal foods, mentioned nutritionist Leema Mahajan in a post on Instagram. It helps to keep the infections and seasonal colds and flu away. It is not only enjoyed for its taste but also valued for its potential health benefits. Also great to prevent obesity-related fatty liver. Believed to have diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, it is a good source of dietary fibre, vitamins A and C, and minerals like potassium and calcium,” Mahajan said. Concurred Dr Ushakiran Sisodia, registered dietician and clinical nutritionist, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai and said that kantoli is known to be rich in vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin B9 (folate) and contains minerals like iron, magnesium, and potassium. “Most importantly, as it’s low in calories, those following a diet or weight control regime can freely eat it. Being high in fibre, the vegetable aids in digestion and prevents constipation,” said Dr Sisodia.",

Syed Kassim is among the dwindling number of hawkers in Singapore, where efforts are being made to preserve the hawker culture. Another popular dish is “Indian Rojak”, a fusion of Singapore-origin Indian food which is made up of 23 varieties of deep-fried vegetables and meat malls that are consumed with gravy made from crushed peanuts and tamarin. Sagubarsadiq, 38, is another third-generation hawker of Indian descent who is keeping up the Indian-origin food outlet going in Singapore. It was started by his father 34 years ago.
